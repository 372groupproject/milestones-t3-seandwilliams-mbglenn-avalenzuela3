Common business-oriented language, or Cobol, is an English like computer language designed for business use. It was heavely based on the language FLOW-MATIC that was developed by Grace Hopper. Grace would later participate in the development of COBOL. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL(a steering committee sponsored by the US Department of Defense). It was designed to be a portable languages for data processing. The CODASYL Executive Committee approved the specifications on 8 January 1960 and named it COBOL60. It was standardized in 1968 when it was approved by ANSI as a standard commercial use language. There were several releases following the standardization that included fixing some early syntax ambiguity and implementing new features such as scope terminators and nested subprograms. Int 2002, Object-Oriented COBOL was published. Near the end of the 20th century COBOL programing focused on solving the year 2000, or Y2K, problem. Many applications that relied on dates only stored 2 digits in decimal.
