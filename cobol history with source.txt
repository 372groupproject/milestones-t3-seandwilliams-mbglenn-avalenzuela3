Common business-oriented language, or Cobol, is an English like computer language designed for business use. It was heavely based on the language FLOW-MATIC that was developed by Grace Hopper. Grace would later participate in the development of COBOL. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL(a steering committee sponsored by the US Department of Defense). It was designed to be a portable languages for data processing. The CODASYL Executive Committee approved the specifications on 8 January 1960 and named it COBOL60. It was standardized in 1968 when it was approved by ANSI as a standard commercial use language. There were several releases following the standardization that included fixing some early syntax ambiguity and implementing new features such as scope terminators and nested subprograms. Int 2002, Object-Oriented COBOL was published. Near the end of the 20th century COBOL programing focused on solving the year 2000, or Y2K, problem. Many applications that relied on dates only stored 2 digits in decimal. 

Near the end of the 20th century, the year 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of significant COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed[by whom?] to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.[100] The authors said that the survey data suggest "a gradual decline in the importance of Cobol in application development over the [following] 10 years unless ... integration with other languages and technologies can be adopted".[101]

During 1950s, when the businesses were growing in the western part of the world, there was a need to automate various processes for ease of operation and this gave birth to a high-level programming language meant for business data processing.

In 1959, COBOL was developed by CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Language).

The next version, COBOL-61, was released in 1961 with some revisions.

In 1968, COBOL was approved by ANSI as a standard language for commercial use (COBOL-68).

It was again revised in 1974 and 1985 to develop subsequent versions named COBOL-74 and COBOL-85 respectively.

In 2002, Object-Oriented COBOL was released, which could use encapsulated objects as a normal part of COBOL programming.

In the late 1950s, computer users and manufacturers were becoming concerned about the rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.[15]

Grace Hopper, the inventor of FLOW-MATIC, a predecessor to COBOL
On 8 April 1959, Mary K. Hawes, a computer scientist at Burroughs Corporation, called a meeting of representatives from academia, computer users, and manufacturers at the University of Pennsylvania to organize a formal meeting on common business languages.[16] Representatives included Grace Hopper, inventor of the English-like data processing language FLOW-MATIC, Jean Sammet and Saul Gorn.[17][18]

At the April meeting, the group asked the Department of Defense (DoD) to sponsor an effort to create a common business language. The delegation impressed Charles A. Phillips, director of the Data System Research Staff at the DoD,[19] who thought that they "thoroughly understood" the DoD's problems. The DoD operated 225 computers, had a further 175 on order and had spent over $200 million on implementing programs to run on them. Portable programs would save time, reduce costs and ease modernization.[20]

Phillips agreed to sponsor the meeting and tasked the delegation with drafting the agenda.[21]

COBOL 60
On 28 and 29 May 1959 (exactly one year after the Zürich ALGOL 58 meeting), a meeting was held at the Pentagon to discuss the creation of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips.[22] The Department of Defense was concerned about whether it could run the same data processing programs on different computers. FORTRAN, the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.[23]

Representatives enthusiastically described a language that could work in a wide variety of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.[24]

The meeting resulted in the creation of a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees.[25][26] Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.[23] The deadline was met with disbelief by the short-range committee.[27] One member, Betty Holberton, described the three-month deadline as "gross optimism" and doubted that the language really would be a stopgap.[28]

The steering committee met on 4 June and agreed to name the entire activity as the Committee on Data Systems Languages, or CODASYL, and to form an executive committee.[29]

The short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (Honeywell Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government agencies were the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology).[30] The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards. Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.[31]

The committee mainly examined the FLOW-MATIC, AIMACO and COMTRAN programming languages.[23][32] The FLOW-MATIC language was particularly influential because it had been implemented and because AIMACO was a derivative of it with only minor changes.[33][34] FLOW-MATIC's inventor, Grace Hopper, also served as a technical adviser to the committee.[27] FLOW-MATIC's major contributions to COBOL were long variable names, English words for commands and the separation of data descriptions and instructions.[35]

IBM's COMTRAN language, invented by Bob Bemer, was regarded as a competitor to FLOW-MATIC[36][37] by a short-range committee made up of colleagues of Grace Hopper.[38] Some of its features were not incorporated into COBOL so that it would not look like IBM had dominated the design process,[25] and Jean Sammet said in 1981 that there had been a "strong anti-IBM bias" from some committee members (herself included).[39] In one case, after Roy Goldfinger, author of the COMTRAN manual and intermediate-range committee member, attended a subcommittee meeting to support his language and encourage the use of algebraic expressions, Grace Hopper sent a memo to the short-range committee reiterating Sperry Rand's efforts to create a language based on English.[40] In 1980, Grace Hopper commented that "COBOL 60 is 95% FLOW-MATIC" and that COMTRAN had had an "extremely small" influence. Furthermore, she said that she would claim that work was influenced by both FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN only to "keep other people happy [so they] wouldn't try to knock us out".[41] Features from COMTRAN incorporated into COBOL included formulas,[42] the PICTURE clause,[43] an improved IF statement, which obviated the need for GO TOs, and a more robust file management system.[36]

The usefulness of the committee's work was subject of great debate. While some members thought the language had too many compromises and was the result of design by committee, others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.[44] Controversial features included those some considered useless or too advanced for data processing users. Such features included boolean expressions, formulas and table subscripts (indices).[45][46] Another point of controversy was whether to make keywords context-sensitive and the effect that would have on readability.[45] Although context-sensitive keywords were rejected, the approach was later used in PL/I and partially in COBOL from 2002.[47] Little consideration was given to interactivity, interaction with operating systems (few existed at that time) and functions (thought of as purely mathematical and of no use in data processing).[48][49]

The specifications were presented to the Executive Committee on 4 September. They fell short of expectations: Joseph Wegstein noted that "it contains rough spots and requires some additions", and Bob Bemer later described them as a "hodgepodge". The subcommittee was given until December to improve it.[27]

At a mid-September meeting, the committee discussed the new language's name. Suggestions included "BUSY" (Business System), "INFOSYL" (Information System Language) and "COCOSYL" (Common Computer Systems Language).[50] The name "COBOL" was suggested by Bob Bemer.[51][52]

In October, the intermediate-range committee received copies of the FACT language specification created by Roy Nutt. Its features impressed the committee so much that they passed a resolution to base COBOL on it.[53] This was a blow to the short-range committee, who had made good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation,[27] allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.[54]

'And what name do you want inscribed?'
I said, 'I'll write it for you.' I wrote the name down: COBOL.
'What kind of name is that?'
'Well it's a Polish name. We shortened it and got rid of a lot of unnecessary notation.'

Howard Bromberg on how he bought the COBOL tombstone[55]
It soon became apparent that the committee was too large for any further progress to be made quickly. A frustrated Howard Bromberg bought a $15 tombstone with "COBOL" engraved on it and sent it to Charles Phillips to demonstrate his displeasure.[b][55][57] A sub-committee was formed to analyze existing languages and was made up of six individuals:[23][58]

William Selden and Gertrude Tierney of IBM,
Howard Bromberg and Howard Discount of RCA,
Vernon Reeves and Jean E. Sammet of Sylvania Electric Products.
The sub-committee did most of the work creating the specification, leaving the short-range committee to review and modify their work before producing the finished specification.[23]

The specifications were approved by the Executive Committee on 8 January 1960, and sent to the government printing office, which printed these as COBOL 60. The language's stated objectives were to allow efficient, portable programs to be easily written, to allow users to move to new systems with minimal effort and cost, and to be suitable for inexperienced programmers.[59] The CODASYL Executive Committee later created the COBOL Maintenance Committee to answer questions from users and vendors and to improve and expand the specifications.[60]

During 1960, the list of manufacturers planning to build COBOL compilers grew. By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (Bendix, Control Data Corporation, General Electric (GE), National Cash Register and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers. GE and IBM planned to integrate COBOL into their own languages, GECOM and COMTRAN, respectively. In contrast, International Computers and Tabulators planned to replace their language, CODEL, with COBOL.[61]

Meanwhile, RCA and Sperry Rand worked on creating COBOL compilers. The first COBOL program ran on 17 August on an RCA 501.[62] On 6 and 7 December, the same COBOL program (albeit with minor changes) ran on an RCA computer and a Remington-Rand Univac computer, demonstrating that compatibility could be achieved.[63]

The relative influences of which languages were used continues to this day in the recommended advisory printed in all COBOL reference manuals:

COBOL-61 to COBOL-65
It is rather unlikely that Cobol will be around by the end of the decade.
Anonymous, June 1960[65]
Many logical flaws were found in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn that it could not be interpreted unambiguously. A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, it was reported that COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.[61]

Early COBOL compilers were primitive and slow. A 1962 US Navy evaluation found compilation speeds of 3–11 statements per minute. By mid-1964, they had increased to 11–1000 statements per minute. It was observed that increasing memory would drastically increase speed and that compilation costs varied wildly: costs per statement were between $0.23 and $18.91.[66]

In late 1962, IBM announced that COBOL would be their primary development language and that development of COMTRAN would cease.[66]

The COBOL specification was revised three times in the five years after its publication. COBOL-60 was replaced in 1961 by COBOL-61. This was then replaced by the COBOL-61 Extended specifications in 1963, which introduced the sort and report writer facilities.[67] The added facilities corrected flaws identified by Honeywell in late 1959 in a letter to the short-range committee.[62] COBOL Edition 1965 brought further clarifications to the specifications and introduced facilities for handling mass storage files and tables.[68]

COBOL-68
Efforts began to standardize COBOL to overcome incompatibilities between versions. In late 1962, both ISO and the United States of America Standards Institute (now ANSI) formed groups to create standards. ANSI produced USA Standard COBOL X3.23 in August 1968, which became the cornerstone for later versions.[69] This version was known as American National Standard (ANS) COBOL and was adopted by ISO in 1972.[70]

COBOL-74
By 1970, COBOL had become the most widely used programming language in the world.[71]

Independently of the ANSI committee, the CODASYL Programming Language Committee was working on improving the language. They described new versions in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1973, including changes such as new inter-program communication, debugging and file merging facilities as well as improved string-handling and library inclusion features.[72] Although CODASYL was independent of the ANSI committee, the CODASYL Journal of Development was used by ANSI to identify features that were popular enough to warrant implementing.[73] The Programming Language Committee also liaised with ECMA and the Japanese COBOL Standard committee.[72]

The Programming Language Committee was not well-known, however. The vice-president, William Rinehuls, complained that two-thirds of the COBOL community did not know of the committee's existence. It was also poor, lacking the funds to make public documents, such as minutes of meetings and change proposals, freely available.[74]

In 1974, ANSI published a revised version of (ANS) COBOL, containing new features such as file organizations, the DELETE statement[75] and the segmentation module.[76] Deleted features included the NOTE statement, the EXAMINE statement (which was replaced by INSPECT) and the implementer-defined random access module (which was superseded by the new sequential and relative I/O modules). These made up 44 changes, which rendered existing statements incompatible with the new standard.[77] The report writer was slated to be removed from COBOL, but was reinstated before the standard was published.[78][79] ISO later adopted the updated standard in 1978.[70]

COBOL-85
In June 1978, work began on revising COBOL-74. The proposed standard (commonly called COBOL-80) differed significantly from the previous one, causing concerns about incompatibility and conversion costs. In January 1981, Joseph T. Brophy, Senior Vice-President of Travelers Insurance, threatened to sue the standard committee because it was not upwards compatible with COBOL-74. Mr. Brophy described previous conversions of their 40-million-line code base as "non-productive" and a "complete waste of our programmer resources".[80] Later that year, the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) said it was "strongly opposed" to the new standard, citing "prohibitive" conversion costs and enhancements that were "forced on the user".[81][82]

During the first public review period, the committee received 2,200 responses, of which 1,700 were negative form letters.[83] Other responses were detailed analyses of the effect COBOL-80 would have on their systems; conversion costs were predicted to be at least 50 cents per line of code. Fewer than a dozen of the responses were in favor of the proposed standard.[84]

ISO TC97-SC5 installed in 1979 the international COBOL Experts Group, on initiative of Wim Ebbinkhuijsen. The group consisted of COBOL experts from many countries, including the USA. Its goal was to achieve mutual understanding and respect between ANSI and the rest of the world with regard to the need of new COBOL features. After three years, ISO changed the status of the group to a formal Working Group: WG4 COBOL. The group took primary ownership and development of the COBOL standard, where ANSI did most of the proposals.

In 1983, the DPMA withdrew its opposition to the standard, citing the responsiveness of the committee to public concerns. In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards study concluded that the proposed standard would present few problems.[82][85] A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were particularly well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.[86]

The second public review drew another 1,000 (mainly negative) responses, while the last drew just 25, by which time many concerns had been addressed.[82]

In 1985, the ISO Working Group 4 accepted the then-version of the ANSI proposed standard, made several changes and set it as the new ISO standard COBOL 85. It was published in late 1985.

Sixty features were changed or deprecated and many[quantify] were added, such as:[87][88]

Scope terminators (END-IF, END-PERFORM, END-READ, etc.)
Nested subprograms
CONTINUE, a no-operation statement
EVALUATE, a switch statement
INITIALIZE, a statement that can set groups of data to their default values
Inline PERFORM loop bodies – previously, loop bodies had to be specified in a separate procedure
Reference modification, which allows access to substrings
I/O status codes.
The new standard was adopted by all national standard bodies, including ANSI.[70]

Two amendments followed in 1989 and 1993, the first introducing intrinsic functions and the other providing corrections.,[70]

COBOL 2002 and object-oriented COBOL
In 1997, Gartner Group estimated that there were a total of 200 billion lines of COBOL in existence, which ran 80% of all business programs.[89][better source needed]

In the early 1990s, work began on adding object-orientation in the next full revision of COBOL. Object-oriented features were taken from C++ and Smalltalk.[1][2] The initial estimate was to have this revision completed by 1997, and an ISO Committee Draft (CD) was available by 1997. Some vendors (including Micro Focus, Fujitsu, and IBM) introduced object-oriented syntax based on drafts of the full revision. The final approved ISO standard was approved and published in late 2002.[90]

Fujitsu/GTSoftware,[91] Micro Focus and RainCode introduced object-oriented COBOL compilers targeting the .NET Framework.

There were many other new features, many of which had been in the CODASYL COBOL Journal of Development since 1978 and had missed the opportunity to be included in COBOL-85.[92] These other features included:[93][94]

Free-form code
User-defined functions
Recursion
Locale-based processing
Support for extended character sets such as Unicode
Floating-point and binary data types (until then, binary items were truncated based on their declaration's base-10 specification)
Portable arithmetic results
Bit and boolean data types
Pointers and syntax for getting and freeing storage
The SCREEN SECTION for text-based user interfaces
The VALIDATE facility
Improved interoperability with other programming languages and framework environments such as .NET and Java.
Three corrigenda were published for the standard: two in 2006 and one in 2009.[95]

COBOL 2014
Between 2003 and 2009, three technical reports were produced describing object finalization, XML processing and collection classes for COBOL.[95]

COBOL 2002 suffered from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus found that it was due to a lack of user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.[96]

COBOL 2014 includes the following changes:[97]

Portable arithmetic results have been replaced by IEEE 754 data types
Major features have been made optional, such as the VALIDATE facility, the report writer and the screen-handling facility.
Method overloading
Dynamic capacity tables (a feature dropped from the draft of COBOL 2002)[98]
Legacy
COBOL programs are used globally in governments and businesses and are running on diverse operating systems such as z/OS, z/VSE, VME, Unix, OpenVMS and Windows. In 1997, the Gartner Group reported that 80% of the world's business ran on COBOL with over 200 billion lines of code and 5 billion lines more being written annually.[99]

Near the end of the 20th century, the year 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of significant COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed[by whom?] to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.[100] The authors said that the survey data suggest "a gradual decline in the importance of Cobol in application development over the [following] 10 years unless ... integration with other languages and technologies can be adopted".[101]

In 2006 and 2012, Computerworld surveys found that over 60% of organizations used COBOL (more than C++ and Visual Basic .NET) and that for half of those, COBOL was used for the majority of their internal software.[8][102] 36% of managers said they planned to migrate from COBOL, and 25% said they would like to if it was cheaper. Instead, some businesses have migrated their systems from expensive mainframes to cheaper, more modern systems, while maintaining their COBOL programs.[8]

Testimony before the House of Representatives in 2016 indicated that COBOL is still in use by many federal agencies.[103]
