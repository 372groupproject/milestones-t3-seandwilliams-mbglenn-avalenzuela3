For the execution of WTM-INTERNATIONAL You will need to run the program with a file named "input.txt" in the same directory 
and folder that you have the compiled program in order for this to work properly and with no issues. With the format of the salary you have in dollars followed by, rent, bills, food, travel, tax percentage, all on their own line, then once the program boots up then you enter in the currency you would like to see your budget in, i.e. Dollars, Francs, Yen, Krona, Pounds, or Euros then the program will complete and be finished, with different amounts causing different suggestions and a bit of humor ;)
